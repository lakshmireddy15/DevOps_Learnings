## user mangement:

Here we want add user or groups. so we need to add admin. 

```bash
sudo su -         # To login as a admin
useradd <username>         # To crate user
id <username>              # To check whether the user is created or not. It will display the user information
```

In linux we have 2 types of groups  
1..Primary group (gid)  
2.secordary gruop (groups)  
when you create any user by deafault group also created.  
one primary group atleast one secondary group  

```bash
cat /etc/passwd       # It will show users list  
cat /etc/group        # It will show group list
```

```bash
groupadd <groupname>                # It will create groupname
usermod -g <groupname> <username>   # It will add user to particular group
usermod -aG <groupname> <username>  # It will add user to particular group 
```

- `-g` means primary group  
- `-aG` means secorndary group

```bash
userdel <username>     # It will delete the user
groupdel <groupname>   # It will delete the group
```

## set the password to user:

```bash
useradd <username>
passwd <username>
```

Try to login in another window with the latest user

first it will denied the permisssion beacuse we need to modigy the configuration file

```bash
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Change the below line:

```
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

```bash
systemctl restart sshd
```

Now you can able to login
