# üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Machine

There are a lot of servers we have created, but we haven't used 100% of CPU and RAM.  
Here, a lot of data is wasted, so this is called **inefficiency**.

With the concept of **virtualization**, we install a **hypervisor**.

- **Hypervisor** is a software that can be installed on a physical machine (not inside the VM).
- Here we can do **logical isolation**.
- In AWS, you don‚Äôt see the physical machine, but behind the scenes
- We add **efficiency** using the hypervisor by logically separating resources.
- There is **no dependency** between all VMs ‚Äî every VM has its own CPU, RAM, and all other components.

# üêß LINUX OS

**Operating System** means it is the **bridge between software and hardware components**.

### Example:

When we use a program (browser or any app), it doesn't talk to hardware components like CPU, memory, or disk directly.  
Instead, it uses the **Operating System (OS)**.

## üîß Key components between software and hardware:

### ‚úÖ System Software
- Software that runs the system and helps work with hardware (e.g., **libraries**, **drivers**)

### ‚úÖ User Process
- A program started by the user (e.g., **Chrome**, **a Python script**, etc.)

### ‚úÖ System Libraries

- Ready-made code that both apps and the OS can use (e.g., **math functions**, **file handling**)
- System libraries are responsible for performing tasks like calculations, file handling, etc., so that applications don't have to write those from scratch.


### ‚úÖ Kernel
- This is the **main part of the OS** that talks to hardware and controls everything.
- Kernel is responsible for communication between software and hardware.

#### Kernel Responsibilities:
- Device Management  
- Memory Management  
- Process Management  
- Handling Management  

### ‚úÖ OS
- Software that **manages hardware** and lets applications run.

# üñ•Ô∏è Physical Machine vs Virtual Machine

## What is a Physical Machine?
- A **physical machine** is a real, tangible computer or server.
- It contains actual **hardware components** such as:
  - **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
  - **RAM (Memory)**
  - **Storage** (Hard disk or SSD)
  - **Network interfaces** (LAN/Wi-Fi)
- Requires **physical access** for:
  - Maintenance
  - Hardware upgrades
  - Troubleshooting
- **Example:** Personal desktop computer, on-premise server.

## üíª What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?
- A **virtual machine** is a software-based emulation of a computer.
- It runs on a **physical machine** using a **hypervisor** (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox, KVM).
- Allows **multiple VMs to run on a single physical server**.
- Each VM has:
  - Its own virtual CPU
  - Virtual RAM
  - Virtual storage
  - Separate operating system (OS)
- Provides **isolation**: Each VM operates independently.
- Common uses:
  - **Cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - **Development and testing**
  - **Running different operating systems**

# üß© Hardware and Software Components

## üîß Hardware Components
These are the **physical parts** of a computer system:
- **CPU** ‚Äì Central Processing Unit
- **RAM** ‚Äì Random Access Memory
- **Input devices** ‚Äì Mouse, keyboard, microphone
- **Output devices** ‚Äì Monitor, printer, speakers
- **Storage devices** ‚Äì Hard drive, SSD

## üíæ Software Components
- Software is a **collection of instructions and data** that tells the hardware what to do.
- Types of software:
  - **Operating System** (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
  - **Application Software** (e.g., browsers, games, text editors)
  - **Device Drivers** (to control hardware devices)
